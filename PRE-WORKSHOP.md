# Pre-Workshop Setup

During the workshop, you will be using GitHub and its Codespaces service. GitHub
offers a free tier that provides more than enough free, monthly credits for what
you will need for this workshop.

We kindly ask that you try to complete these setup instructions before attending the
workshop. They should take about 15-30m.

If you are unable to complete the instructions, please do not worry. Participants
will be working in small teams, and so long as one person in each team was able
to complete the instructions, we should have a critical mass for the workshop.

If you need help (or just want to chat with us),
please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/EVtNSxS9E2)
and chat with us in our help channel.

## Instructions

1. Sign up for a [GitHub](github.com) account. You may use an existing account.

2. Sign in to [GitHub](github.com).

3. Fork our [CCSCNE 2025 workshop repository](https://github.com/ourPLCC/CCSCNE-2025) by...

    a. Navigating to <https://github.com/ourPLCC/CCSCNE-2025> and
    b. Selecting `Fork` and then `Create fork`.

4. Create and start a codespace for your fork
   by selecting `Code` -> `Codespaces` -> `Create codespace on main`.

5. Wait for GitHub to build your codespace. It may take several minutes.
   The next time you can reuse the codespace, and so connecting to it will be much faster.

5. Test the codespace by trying each of the following commands in the codespace's terminal.
   For each you should see a version number and no errors.

    ```
    javac --version
    python --verion
    plcc --version
    ```

6. Stop the codespace by clicking `>< Codespaces:` in the lower left and then selecting `Stop Current Codespace`.
   You may safely close the tab.

Stopping your codespace is important to save your monthly, free compute credits from GitHub.
After the workshop you may also want to delete the codespace to save your monthly, free storage credits from GitHub.
To manage your codespaces, sign in to GitHub, select the hamburger menu (â˜°) in the upper left, and select `Codespaces`.

See you soon!
